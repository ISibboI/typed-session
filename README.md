Use typed-session to outsource all the low-level details of session management, such as session expiration and automatic renewal as well as change tracking of session data.
Typed-session was designed with security, efficiency and usability in mind.

Currently, the following session stores are available:

 * `MemoryStore`, a debug session store available under the feature flag `memory-store`.

Currently, typed-session is integrated into the following web frameworks:

 * none so far

## Security

We have designed and implemented the crate with security in mind.
Our design fulfils the requirements stated in [The OWASP® Foundation](https://owasp.org)'s cheat sheet on [session management](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html).
We additionally hash the session ids using the fast and secure hash function [blake3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE_(hash_function)#BLAKE3) before storing them.
To mitigate exploitable bugs we use ``#![deny(unsafe_code)]`` to ensure everything is implemented in 100% safe Rust.

So far, this crate has not been reviewed for security.
