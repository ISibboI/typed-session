## Security

We have designed and implemented the crate with security in mind.
Our design fulfils the requirements stated in [The OWASPÂ® Foundation](https://owasp.org)'s cheat sheet on [session management](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html).
We additionally hash the session ids using the fast and secure hash function [blake3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE_(hash_function)#BLAKE3) before storing them.
To mitigate exploitable bugs we use ``#![deny(unsafe_code)]`` to ensure everything is implemented in 100% safe Rust.

So far, this crate has not been reviewed for security.
